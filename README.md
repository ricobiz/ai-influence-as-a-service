- **Scenario Pipelines**: Automated campaign scripts (trend gen, mass action, monitoring)
- **Analytics**: Grafana & FastAPI dashboards; metrics, alerts

## AI Infrastructure Setup
- Provision cloud/VPS in target geo
- Deploy via Docker or direct (infra/server.py)
- OpenAI/Suno/Midjourney API keys and configuration
- Selenium/Puppeteer setup for bot automation

## Bots & Modules
- **content_gen_bot.py**: GPT-based trending content/posts generator
- **soc_inter_sim_bot.py**: Simulates likes, shares, comments, engagement
- **click_bot.py**: Emulates many organic clickstreams; anti-detect
- **parser_bot.py** (extensible): For real-time analytics/monitoring

## API & Usage
- RESTful API (see infra/server.py, src/main.py)
- CLI: `python bots/content_gen_bot.py <topic> [style] [platform]`
- CLI: `python bots/click_bot.py <url> [selector] [delay]`

## Analytics & Dashboard
- Grafana endpoint, FastAPI `/metrics` hooks
- Tracked: reach, retention, virality, growth dynamics

## Roles
- **Superadmin**: Infra/root, agent config
- **Compliance Checker**: Risk, ethics, anti-block, legal

## Autonomous Operation
- Agents self-run: scenario scripting, campaign triggers, result parsing, reporting
- Human input: only for edge/root/admin, legal stops

## A/B Testing & Continuous Evolution
- Built-in A/B for scenario and antifraud bypass
- Self-adapts to new algorithms/platforms

## Example: Running a Spotify Trend
1. Define scenario—"Promote track to 10k listens"
2. API or CLI triggers campaign
3. Bots execute (plays, interaction, trend)
4. Parser module/Analytics dashboard reports live

## Getting Started
1. `git clone https://github.com/ricobiz/ai-influence-as-a-service`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure .env/API keys
4. Start server: `uvicorn infra.server:app --reload`
5. Run content/click bots as needed

## Demo/Contact
